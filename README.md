## Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I'm an SEO professional turned web developer with a passion for problem-solving, continuous learning, and building meaningful digital experiences. After years of working in SEO, I decided to take my knowledge of websites to the next level by diving deep into full-stack development.

Currently, I'm working through Colt Steeleâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp, bolstering my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies.
